# Always On TV - Backend

This is the backend component of the Always On TV project. It provides the necessary functionality to run two web servers on ports 8085 and 8086. Please note that the port numbers can be configured according to your needs. For the frontend code, please refer to the [AlwaysOnTV/AlwaysOnTV-Frontend](https://github.com/AlwaysOnTV/AlwaysOnTV-Frontend) repository.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

This will install all the required packages and libraries.

## Getting Started

To start the backend servers, use the following command:

```
npm start
```

This will initiate the web servers on ports 8085 and 8086, respectively.

## Configuration

By default, the backend generates a `config.json` file with default configuration settings. You can modify this file to adjust the behavior of the servers according to your requirements.

## Usage with AlwaysOnTV-Frontend

For the best experience, it is recommended to use this backend in combination with the [AlwaysOnTV-Frontend](https://github.com/AlwaysOnTV/AlwaysOnTV-Frontend) project. The frontend component provides the user interface and interacts with the backend to display content on the Always On TV screens.

Please refer to the documentation of the frontend project for instructions on how to set it up and integrate it with the backend.
